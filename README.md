# Relation Extraction

## Transformer Model
### How to Run the Demo
1. Download the trained model weights from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uKSeuQqHLkwXNS2lk4gMylQwRmoqvNIo/view?usp=drive_link) (~450MB, too big to store in the Git repo directly) and save them to `models/transformer.pt`.
2. Open the `models/transformer.ipynb` notebook.
3. Run the first (`Options`) and second (`Transformer Model`) code cells.
4. Run the final (`Model Demo`) code cell.
5. Enter input sentences (including entity delimiters, as described in the notebook) to see the predicted relations and their corresponding probabilities.
